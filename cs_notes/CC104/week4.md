# Week 4
## Calculating the Memory Address of an element

### One-Dimensional Arrays
- Definition:
  * Also known as 1-D arrays.
  * Are a type of a linear array where the elements are accessed using a single index.
  * The index, represents either a row or column position in the array.
- Formula:
  * **One-Dimensional Array Formula**
    $$Address[Index] = B + W * (Index - LB)$$
  * Where:
    + _Address_ 
      - Is the Address of the element in the array.
    + _Index_ 
      - Is the position of the element being calculated.
      - Not the element's actual value, only the address.
    + _B_
      - The base address of the array.
      - Or the starting memory address of the array in memory.
    + _W_
      - The storage size of each element in bytes.
      - Different data types have different sizes.
    * _LB_
       - The lower bound value.
       - Default value is 0 if not specified.
- Example:
  * Assume an array A[500..800] with:
    + B = 2000
    * W = 4 bytes
    * LB = 500
  * What is the address of A[750]?
  * Solution:
  ```
    Address of A[750] = 2000 + 4 * (750 - 500)
                      = 2000 + 4 * (250)
                      = 2000 + 1000
                      = 3000
  ```

### Two-Dimensional Arrays
- Definition:
  * Also known as 2-D arrays, or array of arrays.
  * Similar to a Matrix, with its grid-like structure—with rows and columns having their own elements.
  * It is specified by using two subscripts:
    + Row size
    + Column size
  * There are two ways to calculate the memory address of a 2-D array element.

  | Array | col 0 | col 1 | col 2 |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | row 0 | a[0][0] | a[0][1] | a[0][2] |
  | row 1 | a[1][0] | a[1][1] | a[1][2] |
  | row 2 | a[2][0] | a[2][1] | a[2][2] |
- __2-D Row Major Order__
  * Definition
    + In this type of 2-D array, the elements of an array are stored in one row at a time.
    + Meaning, all the elements in the first row are stored first in memory, then all the elements in the second row, and so on.
    * The elements are __horizontally linear__ in memory.
  * Formula:
    + __Two Dimensional Row Major Order Formula__
      $$Address[I][J] = B + W * {(I - LR) * N + (J - LC)}
    + Where:
      - _Address_ 
        * Is the Address of the element in the array.
      - _I_
        * Row number of the element being calculated.
      - _J_
        * Column number of the element being calculated.
      - _B_
        * The base address of the array.
        * Or the starting memory address of the array in memory. 
      - _W_
        * The storage size of each element in bytes.
        * Different data types have different sizes.
      - _LR_
        - Lower Limit of Row or Starting Row Index.
        - Default value is 0 if not specified.
      - _LC_
        - Lower Limit of Column or Starting Column Index.
        - Default value is 0 if not specified.
      - _N_
        - The total number of columns in the array
        - Formula:
          $$UC - LC + 1$$
  + Example:
    - Given an array, A[2..12][3..18] with a base address of 200 and each element having a size of 2 bytes in memory, find the address of A[10][5] using row-major order.
      * A[2..12][3.18] means rows ranging from 2 to 12 and columns ranging from 3 to 18.
      * Given:
        + B = 200
        + W = 2 bytes
        + I = 10
        + J = 5
        + LR = 2
        + LC = 3
        + N = 16
    - Solution:
    ```
         A[I][J] = B + W * {(I - LR) * N + (J - LC)}
        A[10][5] = 200 + 2 * {(10 - 2) * 16 + (5 - 3)}
                 = 200 + 2 * {(8) * 16 + (2)}
                 = 200 + 2 * {128 + (2)}
                 = 200 + 2 * {130}
                 = 200 + 260
                 = 460
    ```
- __2-D Column Major Order__
  * Definition:
    + In this type of 2-D array, the elements of an array are stored in one column at a time.
    + Meaning, all the elements in the first column are stored first in memory, then all the elements in the second column, and so on.
    * The elements are __vertically linear__ in memory.
  * Formula:
    + __Two Dimensional Column Major Order Formula__
      $$Address[I][J] = B + W * {(J - LC) * N + (I - SR)}

          $$UR - LR + 1$$
  + Example:
    - Given an array, A[2..12][3..18] with a base address of 200 and each element having a size of 2 bytes in memory, find the address of A[10][5] using column-major order.
      * A[2..12][3.18] means rows ranging from 2 to 12 and columns ranging from 3 to 18.
      * Given:
        + B = 200
        + W = 2 bytes

        + LC = 3
        + N = 11
    - Solution:
    ```
         A[I][J] = B + W * {(J - LC) * N + (I - LR)}
        A[10][5] = 200 + 2 * {(5 - 3) * 11 + (10 - 2)}
                 = 200 + 2 * {(2) * 11 + (8)}
                 = 200 + 2 * {22 + (8)}
                 = 200 + 2 * {30}
                 = 200 + 60
                 = 260
    ```
