# Week 2

## Prerequisites
- Resources
  * TOPCIT
    + An IT assessment tool used to assess the skills and competencies of information technology specialists and software developers, focusing on the abilities required to perform effectively in professional roles.
    + Originates from South Korea, primarily used for examinations, guaging the level of skill of every participant.
- Lessons and Targets 
  * Understanding and Using Data. In designing and automation of databases and the foundations of what we call databases.

## Databases
- Focus: __Data__
- Main Figure:
```
INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT
```
- Example:
```
Encoding -> Programmers -> Information
```
> Example: Self serving printng kiosk; requiring an input file, the processing of said file, and the output (e.g. costs).

### Evolution of Databases:
- File Cabinets - Before 1950s
  * Bugs came from physical bugs.
- Magnetic Tapes - 1950s and early 1960s
  * _Cassettes_ are an example of magnetic tapes.
  * The files in in magnetic tapes are only able to be accessed sequentially, read and writen to in a form of a sequence.
  * Reading data sequentially dramatically increased read and write time, needing a significant amount of time before the required data is read.
- Hard Disk Drives
  * Removes the old problem of needing to read and write data sequentially in favor of mechanically moving disks, cutting down on time to milliseconds.
  * The moving parts made it susceptible to damages when abruptly events occur, e.g. shut down abruptly.
- Solid State Drives
  * This is now the current day Database Storage.
  * Databases are now able to store images and media.
### Organization
- Databases must be organized in order to store, retrieve, and manage data effiently.
- Types of Databases:
  * Relational Databases
    + The most popular type of database today, being stored in __tables__ with each __row__ representing records and each __column__ representing the attributes of each records.
    + Every single piece of information has a relationship with every other piece of information. Accounting for every data value in the database with a __unique identity__ in the form of a record.
    + All records in this type of database must be tabulated and tabularized therefore, every row of data in the database is linked with another row with a __primary__ key.
    + Similaryly, every table is linked with another table using a foreign key.
    + Scaling and traversing through data in a Relational Database is a lightweight task in comparison to other database types, i.e. Hierchical Databases.
  * NoSQL
    + A non-SQL or non-relational database wherein it provides mechanisms for storing and retrieving data that does not rely on traditional table-based relational models.
    * Instead, it uses flecible data models like key-value pairs, documents, column families, or graphs, making it ideal for handling unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data.
<!-- Fundatmental Systems Design: ig research more about it? the professor said something about using TOPCIT -->

## Information Systems
- Foundation
  * _Data_ is __raw__, __unorganized__ pieces of facts or figure which can be collected, discovered, investigated, or obtained from sources.
  * _Information_ is the __processed__ or __systemized__ data which provides __meaningful__ insights.
  * _Databases_ are an __organized collection__ of logically related data stored for easy access and retrieval.
  * _Knowledge_ are __generalizations__ from separate pieces of information.
- Types of Data Processing
> Different types of databases store data differently,
- Batch Processing.
  * Collects batch amounts of data during a certain period and only processed periodically.
  * Characteristics: System-Centered process
    + The users must adjust to the System. Low processing costs and high yields. preparatory work is required, standby time is required, immediate processing is not supported, modifying the process is complex and only modifyable after the information is processed.
- Real-time Processing
  * Data is processed the immediately after a transaction occurs.
    + example: Online Processing.
  * Characteristics: User-centered processing. 
    + The systems must adjust to the users. High Processing cost, low system maintenance cost. Difficult to maintain or store. 

<!-- Review TOPCIT, focusing on the technical aspects of creating databases. Finals; create a pretty decent database, manually creating the database design. -->
