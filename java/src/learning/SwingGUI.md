# Swing GUI
- Background
    - Abstract Window Toolkit (_AWT_)
        - AWT was Java's original _GUI_ library used for creating window-based applications.
        - It provides basic components fuch as buttons, labels, text fields, and menus, relying on the native operating system's _GUI_ components.
        - It was part of the _java.awt_ package and uses native platform components, leading it to be platform-dependent in appearance.
        - It provided basic _GUI_ controls and event-handling mechanisms, and serves as the foundation on which Java Swing is built.
    - Java Foundation Classes
        - It is the set of _GUI_ components that simplify desktop applications.
        - There is a common misconception that programmers think; _JFC_ and Java Swing are one and the same thing, but that is not the case.
        - _JFC_ contains Java Swing, and quite a number of other items:
            - Cut and paste — clipboard support.
            - Accessibility features — aimed at developing _GUIs_ for users with disablities.
            - Desktop Colors Features — introduced in Java 1.1.
            - Java 2D — has improved colors, images, and text support.

- Java Swing
    - Definition:
        - Is a Graphical User Interface (_GUI_) toolkit, that is part of the _JFC_ .
        - It provides a rich set of lightweight components for building desktop applications, all with a more flexible and feature-rich interface than _AWT_.
        - The _JFC_ provides a wide variety of _GUI_ components such as buttons, labels, trees, and trees.
        - It also supports a pluggable _Look and Feel_, allowing applications to have a customized appearance.
        - _JFC_ is platform-independent, allows applications to run consistently across different operating systems.
    - Swing Classes Hierarchy
        - The core GUI components such as _JFrame, JButton, JLabel, JCheckBox, JList, and JProgressBar_ are derived from base classes like _Container, JComponent_ within the Java Swing Framework.
    - Features of Java Swing:
        - Platform Independent
            - Swing components provide a consistent GUI across different operating systems without depending on native OS controls.
        - Lightweight Components
            - Swing components are written entirely in Java and do not rely on platform-specific system resources.
        - Pluggable Look and Feel 
            - Swing allows the appearance of components to be changed dynamically without modifying the application code.
        - MVC Architecture
            - Swing follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, separating data, UI, and control logic.
        - Highly Customizable
            - Swing components can be easily customized to match specific application requirements.
        - Rich Set of Controls 
            - Swing provides advanced GUI components such as JTable, JTree, JTabbedPane, and JScrollPane.
        - Advanced Event Handling
            -  Swing offers a robust event-handling mechanism to efficiently respond to user actions.
    - Advantages of Swing over AWT
        - Image Support
            - Swing components such as buttons and labels can display images along with or instead of text.
        - Custom Borders 
            - Borders of Swing components can be easily customized to improve the UI appearance.
        - Non-Rectangular Components
            - Swing allows components such as buttons to have custom shapes, including round buttons.
        - Accessibility Support
            - Swing integrates well with assistive technologies like screen readers, making applications more accessible to users with disabilities.
    - GUI Creation:  
        - Prerequisites: 
            - In order to use the Java Swing, the library must first be imported.
        - Syntax:
            ```
            import javax.swing.*;
            ```
        - Note
            - _import java.swing.*_ imports all top-level classes from the _javax.swing_ package.
            - the 'x' in _javax_ stands for extension, due to Swing being built on top of the old AWT.
        - JButton
            - Definition:
                - Is a component that allows an interactive visual button object.
            - Syntax:

                    - Definition:
                        - Adds an event listener object to a _JButton_ object's event handling list.
                        - The argument is usually the single method of the _ActionListener_ interface, the abstract method of _actionPerformed_ which takes an _ActionEvent_ object.
                    - Syntax:
                        ```
                        <buttonName>.addActionListener(<listenerObject>);
                        ```
                    - Example:
                        ```

                        - By default, all newly created Swing windows or _JFrame_ window objects are invisible (_.setVisible(false)_) in memory. This allows building and positioning components without trigerring any premature graphical repaints.
                        - Passing a _true_ argument validates the layout tree, calculates screen coordinates, binds native OS window handles, and draws the component hierarchy to the screen.
                    - Syntax:
                        ```
                        <windowName>.setVisible(<boolean>);

        - ActionListener
            - Definition:
                - Is an interface that is used to create event listeners.
                - Event listeners are objects that define functions that are called when a certain even happens; like when a user cliks the mouse of presses a key on the keyboard.
                - To create an event listener, the ActionListener is inherited (implemented) to a child class.
                - Do note that the ActionListener and AciontEvent classes are imported before any code can be created using them. They are imported from the _java.awt.event_ package.
                - Syntax:
                    ```
                    import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;

                ```
                public class eventStuff implements ActionListener {
                    // the class must define the abstract method
                    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent yes) {
                        System.out.println("smth smth");

        - SwingUtilities
            - Definition:
                - Java Swing components are not thread-safe, it is vulnerable to memory corruption and visual glitches.
                - To prevent any unexpected problems, Swing enforces a single-theaded architecture.
                - Almost all code that Swing creates, modifies, or renders must be executed on a single thread, calle the Event Dispatch Thread (_EDT_).
                - When constructing or modifying any of the _JComponent_ through main(), it is directly accessing Swing components from the Main Thread while EDT is actively trying to render them.
                - Having two threads to manipulate the same memory address simultaneously without any form of synchronization can cause unexpended threading bugs.
                - To solve this, the _.invokeLater()_ method is used.
            - The Main Thread vs EDT:
                - Main Thread
                    - When launching a normal Java appication, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) starts executing on the Main Thread.
                    - It is responsible for executing the entry point (_public static void main(String[] args)_) and the general application logic.
                - EDT
                    - When a Swing application is launched, it starts a second background thread—the EDT.
                    - It is responsible for painting graphics, managing window repaint cycles, and handling user inputs—like button clicks, key presses, mouse movements, etc.
            - Solution:
                - Main Point:
                    - This method acts like a safe bridge between the Main Thread (or other threads) and to the EDT.
                    - It takes a Runnable task (can be in the form of a lambda expression) and places it onto the back of Swing's FIFO System Event Queue.
                    - The calling thread (e.g, The Main Thread.) does not stop or wait, it places the task on the queue instantly and resumes execution.
                    - When the EDT finishes its current tasks, it pulss the Runnable task off the queue and executes it safely on the EDI.
                - Without it:
                    - Failing to use _.invokeLater()_ method can break Swing's threading policy and lead to unpredictable behavior.
                    - Two threads reading and writing component properties at the same time can cause Race Conditions.
                    - Even if the application seemingly runs perfectly but under the hood, there is a chance that the program might fail due to heavy CPU load.
                    - Changes made to any components on background threads can often trigger a screen refresh, rendering the GUI looking unresponsive.
            - Methods:
                - .invokeLater()
                    - Definition:
                        - Asynchronous and Non-Blocking.

                        - Used for almost all UI initialization and standard updates.
                    - Syntax:
                        ```
                        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(<runnableTask>);
                        ```
                    - Example:
                        ```
                        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {...});
                        ```

                        - Synchronous and Blocking.
                        - Posts the task and blocks the calling thread until the EDI finishes executing the task.
                    - Note:
                        - Never call _.invokeAndWait()_ from within the EDT itself, or it might cause the application to permanently deadlock.
                    - Syntax:
                        ```
                        SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(<runnableTask>);
                        ```
                    - Example:
                        ```
                        SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(() -> {...});
                        ```
