# data structures
#   - are ways to store and organize data
#       - resulting in various levels of efficiency depending on use
#   - an example of data structures are Python's colections
#       - like list arrays
#       - refer to collections.py for more info
#
#   - Python lists
#       - lists are defined by square brackets [ ]
#       - syntax:
#           <list_name> = [<values>]
#       - example:
#           my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
#       - list methods
#           - there are various built-in methods that are used for operations
#           - like .append() or .sort()
#           - refer to functions.py for more info
#
#   - Stacks
#       - a stack is a linear structure that follows the LIFO principle
#           - being the Last-In-First-Out
#               - the last value added will the first value to be removed
#       - stacks are data structures that can hold many variables
#       - the basic operations that a stack can do is:
#           - push
#               - add elements to the stack (like appending)
#           - pop
#               - removes and returns the top element from the stack
#           - peek
#               - returns the top (logically last) element on the stack
#           - is empty
#               - queries if the stack is empty
#           - size
#               - queries the current size of the stack
#       - stacks in Python are usually implemented using lists or linked lists
#           - which can also be implemented to have undo mechanisms
#               - like reverting to previous states
#           - create algorithms for depth_first search or for backtracing
#
#       - stacks using lists
#           - why stacks using lists or arrays?
#               - memory efficiency
#                   - arrays do not hold the next elements' address
#                   - unlike linked lists with nodes do
#               - implementation
#                   - stacks using arrays requires less code as oppsed to linked lists
#                   - as it is easier to use lists than linked lists
#           - stack implemementation using Python's lists:
#               #> start with an empty stack
#               stack = []
#           
#               #> push elements to the end of the stack
#               stack.append('A')
#               stack.append('B')
#               stack.append('C')
#
#               #> peek at the last element on the stack
#               stack[-1]
#           
#               #> pops the element at the top of the stack
#               stack.pop
#
#               #> checks is the stack is empty
#               not bool(stack) #> empty elements return a false
#           
#               #> checks the size of the stack
#               len(stack)
#           - it is recommended to create a dedicated stack class
#               - such that the methods are a bit more straight forward
#           - sample code:
#               class Stack:
#                   #> creates an empty stack
#                   def __init__(self) -> None:
#                       self.stack = []
#
#                   #> method to check if the stack is empty
#                   def is_empty(self) -> bool:
#                       if len(self.stack):
#                           return False
#                       return True
#
#                   #> method to push elements to the end of the stack
#                   def push(self, value) -> None:
#                       self.stack.append(value)
#   
#                   #> method to pop elements from the end of the stack and return it
#                   def pop(self) -> int | None:
#                       #> checks if the stack is empty
#                       if self.is_empty():
#                           print("stack is empty")
#                           return None
#                       return self.stack.pop()
#           
#                   #> method to return the element at the top of the stack
#                   def peek(self) -> int | None:
#                       #> checks if the stack is empty
#                       if self.is_empty():
#                           print("stack is empty")
#                           return None
#                       return self.stack[-1]
#
#                   #> method to return the size of the stack
#                   def size(self) -> int:
#                       return len(self.stack)
#
#       - stacks using linked lists
#           - why stacks using linked lists?
#               - unlike normal lists
#                   - linked lists are able to be stored where there is free space in memory
#                   - where linked lists do not have to be stored contiguously in memory
#               - unlike lists when an element is removed (popped)
#                   - the rest of the nodes in the linked list do not have to be shifted
#           - sidenote:
#               - even though linked lists are better when dealing with a scattered memory space
#                   - this type of list will use more memory space due to having to also store the node addresses
#               - the code is also more complex
#                   - making it a bit hard to understand or interpret

#   - Queues
#       - this is concept follows the FIFO principle
#           - FIrst-In-First-Out
#               - the first element in would be the first element to be removed
#           - the exact opposite of the LIFO principle
#       - the basic operations that a queue can do it:
#           - enqueue
#               - adds an element to the end of the queue
#           - dequeue
#               - removes the first element on the queue
#           - peek
#               - returns the first element on the queue
#           - is_empty
#               - returns a boolean if queue is empty
#           - size
#               - returns an integer corresponding to the current size of the queue
#       - queue in Python are usually implemented using lists or linked lists
#           - being used for scheduling, order processing, or message queing
#           - or even be used for algorithms like breadth search in graphs
#

#           - sidenote:
#               - unlike stacks, dequeuing items from a queue is generally inefficient
#                   - as it shifts the position of all items in the queue

#   - Linked Lists
#       - is a list whre the nodes are linked together
#       - each node contains both a data and a pointer
#           - the data it stores are able to be any value
#               - like normal arrays
#           - the pointer it holds is a pointer to another node
#       - the elements in this list is linked together such that each node points to where in memory the other node is placed
#       - illustration:
#           |========|     |========|     |========|
#           |  DATA  |   ->|  DATA  |   ->|  DATA  |
#           |========|  /  |========|  /  |========|
#           |  NEXT -|-/   |  NEXT -|-/   |  NEXT -|

#       - linked lists vs arrays (Python)
#           - unlike linked lists, arrays are a existing data structure
#               - unlike linked lists wherein the have to be implemented
#           - in arrays, elements are stored together right next to each other (contiguous)
#               - this is more memory efficient unlike linked lists wherein it has to accomodate nodes as well
#               - while in linked lists, they are store separately in their own part in memory
#           - in linked lists, elements are not able to be accessed directly (random access)
#               - while in arrays, this is not the case
#           - elements are able to be removed or added without any shfiting in linked lists
#               - this is not the case in arrays, due to each element shifting
#           - implementing linked lists is way more complecated unlike built-in arrays
#               - this is due to the logic required to efficiently traverse linked lists
#       - time complexities in Linked Lists Operations
#           - Linear search works the same as normal lists
#               - due to the algorithm searching through each node (element) one after the other
#           - Binary search however, is impractical in linked lists
#               - this is due to the algorithm needing to jump to specific nodes
#               - it is technically possible, but the performance penalty makes it impractical to use
#           - sorting algorithms that goes through each node sequentially is possible in linked lists
#               - but algorithms that requires to jump through each other nodes (or based on an index)
#               - are unlikely to work in linked lists
#       - in linked lists, there are basic operations that is commonly done
#           - traversal
#               - traverses from one node to another
#               - sample code:
#                   #> singly linked lists
#                   class Node:
#                       def __init__(self, value) -> None:
#                           self.data = data
#                           self.next = None
#
#                   #> logic
#                   def traverse(head) -> None:
#                       current_node = head
#                       while current_node:
#                           print(current_node.data, end=" > ")
#                           current_node = current_node.next
#                       print("null")
#           - removing a node
#               - nodes are able to be removed at a constant performace penalty
#               - like removing a certain node, this comes at a constant performace penalty
#           - sort
#               - this type of operation is more complicated but has the same penalties
#       - types of linked lists
#           - singly linked liss
#               - this type of list are the simplest kind of linked lists
#               - it takes up less memory space than other types
#                   - due to each node only being linked to one other node
#               - illustration
#                   |========|     |========|     |========|

#                   |========|     |========|     |========|
#           - double linked lists
#               - this type of linked list has both the address of the next node
#                   - but also has the address of the previous node
#               - this type of link takes up more memory space than single linked nodes
#                   - due to having an additional memory address to store

#           - circular linked lists
#               - this type of linked lists mostly stays the same as doubly linked lists
#                   - but the "head" and "tail" nodes are connected
#               - even though this types of linked lists mostly take the same memory doubly linked lists
#                   - it is a lot more complicated to implement
#               - the trade off is that this type of linked lists are "contiguous"
#                   - the elements inside are able to be cycled through
#                   - though it is required to run checks every time a new node is created or removed
#                       - to check if there are no links that points to null
#               - there are two types of circular linked lists
#                   - a circular singly linked list only points to the next node
#                       - it cannot do so to the previous node

#   - Hash Tables
#       - is a data structure that is designed to be fast to work with
#       - why Hash Tables?
#           - this type of data structure is sometime more prefered instead of arrays
#               - due to being faster when searching, adding, and removing data
#               - even with large amounts of data
#           - hash tables are useful when using a container that is easy to:
#               - find something, like a book in a library
#               - store and find elements quickly
#               - connecting values to keys, the keys are tied to their values
#       - hash tables vs lists
#           - in linked lists
#               - finding an element will take since each node must be checked
#               - only halting when the element has been found, taking O(n) time
#           - in normals lists
#               - even though the element to be found is known, the index is unknown
#               - taking the same amount of time as linked lists due to this
#           - in hash tables
#               - the element can be easily found since there is a way to go to the element directly
#               - through the use of a "hash function"
#               - on average, hash tables table about O(1) time
#       - a hash table is able to be made using 5 key points:
#           - it requires an empty list
#           - it requires a hash function
#           - inserting an element using a hash function
#           - looking up an element using a hash function
#           - handling collisions
#       - sample code:
#           #> create an empty list (can be a set or a dictionary)
#           my_list = [[], [], [], [], []]      #> stores 5 elements
#                                                   #> also called "buckets"
#                                               #> nested arrays prevent collisions
#                                                   #> also called "chaining"   
#
#           #> create a hash function
#           def hash_function(value):
#           hash_sum = 0                        #> stores the value of the has
#           for char in value:                  #> loops through every single character
#               hash_sum += ord(char)           #> converts a character into a unicode code number
#           return hash_sum % 5                 #> uses a modulo to dictate where the value is stored in
#                                               #> different text will result into different hash codes
#                                                   #> using a modulo will make storing a bit easier
#           #> create an add function
#           def add(value):
#               index = hash_function(value)    #> calls the hash_function to return an index
#                                                   #> where the new value is going to be stored in 
#               my_list[index].append(value)    #> appends the new value to the corresponding index
#
#           #> create a loopup function
#           def lookup(value):
#               index = hash_function(value)    #> calls the hash_function to return an index
#                                                   #> looks up where the value might be stored in
#               print(f"{value} is at {index}") #> returns the index wherein the valus is stored at
#
#   - Trees
#       - is a hierachical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges
#           - as each node contains a value and references to its child nodes
#       - similar to linked lists, each node consists of both data and a reference to other nodes
#       - unlike other data structures, in trees, a single element can have multiple 'next' elements
#           - allowing data to branch out in various directions
#       - usecases:
#           - hierachical data
#               - file systems, organizational models, etc.
#           - databases
#               - quick data retrieval
#           - routing tables
#               - used for routing data in network algorithms
#           - sorting or searching
#               - used for sorting data or searching for data
#           - priority queues
#               - priority queues are commonly implemented using trees
#               - such as binary heaps
#       - types of Trees
#           - Binary Trees
#               - each node has up to two children, the left and righr child node
#               - this structure is the foundation for more complex tree types
#                   - like Binary Search Trees, and AVL Trees
#           - Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
#               - a type of a Binary Tree where for each node
#                   - the left child node has a lower value
#                   - and the right child node has a higher value
#           - AVL Trees
#               - named after Adelson-Velsky and Landis
#               - a type of Binary Search Tree that self-balances so that for every node
#                   - the difference between the left and right subtrees is at most one, 1
#               - the balanace is maintained through rotations where nodes are inserted or deleted
#       - Trees vs Lists
#           - arrays
#               - are fast when accessing data directly
#                   - only when the index is known
#               - inserting and deleting elements requires other elements to shift in memeory
#                   - in order to take place for the new element ot to take the place of the deleted element
#                   - this process is very time consuming for very big data sets
#           - linked lists
#               - are fast when inserting and deleting nodes
#                   - it does not require any memory shifting
#               - accessing an element in a linked lists is slow
#                   - as the list must first be traversed to access the element
#           - trees
#               - in Binary Trees, Binary Search Tree and AVL trees
#                   - trees are better due to it being better in accessing and modifying each node
#                   - it does not need to shift memory
#
#       - Binary Trees
#           - is a type of a tree data structure where each node an have up to two child nodes
#               - a left child node and right child node
#           - why Binary Trees?
#               - algorithms that traverse, search, inserts and deletes elemenet are simpler
#                   - easier to implement and runs faster
#               - keeping data in a Binary Search Tree is very efficient when searching for elements
#               - balancing trees are easier to do with a limited number of child nodes
#                   - e.g. using an AVL Binary Tree
#               - Binary Trees can be represented as arrays
#                   - making the tree more memory efficient
#           - type of Binary Trees
#               - balanced trees
#                   - at most, only one difference between is left and right subtree heights
#                       - for each node in the tree

#           - Binary Tree Traversal
#               - going from node to node is called "traversal"
#               - unlike linked lists, since they are linear data structures
#                   - it is only traversible in one of two ways
#                   - at the start of the first node (element) and go forwards or backwards
#               - since trees can branch out to different directions, which is non-linear
#                   - there are different ways of traversing Trees
#               - there are two main categories of Tree traversal methods
#                   - Breadth First Search (BFS)
#                       - is when the nodes on the same level are visited 
#                           - all before going to the next level in the tree
#                       - meaning, that the three is explored in a more sideways direction
#                   - Depth First Search (DFS)
#                       - is when the traversal moves down the tree all to the leaf nodes (external)
#                           - exploring the tree branch by branch in a downwards direction
#                       - there are three different types of DFS traversals:
#                           - pre-order
#                           - in-order
#                           - post-order
#
#                       - Pre-order Traversal
#                           - is a type of DFS, where each node is visited in a certain order
#                           - done by visiting the root node first, 
#                               - then recursively do a pre-order traversal of the left subtree
#                               - followed by a recursive pre-order traversal of the righ subtree
#                           - used for creating a cope of the tree, prefix notation of an expression tree, etc.
#                           - it is called "pre" due to each node is printed before the recursion
#                               - recursion of left to and right subtrees

#       - Binary Search Trees
#           - BST is a type of Binary Tree data structure
#           - the following properties must be true for a node in the tree
#               - the node's left child and all of it's descendants, like its children, children's children, etc.
#                   - must have lower values than the original node's value
#               - the node's right child ald all of its descendants
#                   - must have higher values than the original node's value
#               - the left and right subrees must also be BSTs
#           - these properties makes it faster to seach, add, and delete values than a regular Binary Tree
#           - assuming all values in a BST are unique
#               - the size of a tree and the number of nodes in it is n
#               - a subtree starts with one of the nodes in the tree as a local root
#                   - consists of that node and all of its descendants
#               - the descendants of a node are all the child nodes of that node
#                   - and their child nodes, and that child's child nodes, and so on
#                   - and the descendants will be all nodes that are connected below that node
#               - the node's height is the maximum number of edges betwen that node and a leaf node
#               - a node's in-order successor is the node that comes after it if the in-order traversal is used

#           - BST value searching
#               - finding a value in a BST is similar to using Binary Search on an array
#                   - note using a Binary Search algorithm on an array, it must be first sorted
#                   - since BSTs are already ordered from highest to lowest
#                       - using the same algorithm as Binary Search is very efficient
#               - rules:
#                   - start at the root node
#                   - if the in that node is equal to the target value
#                       - return

#                   - the reason why the time complexity compared to other Data Structures is O(log n)
#                       - is only true if the tree is balanced
#                           - refer to types of Binary Trees
#                   - for a balanced BST, with a large number of nodes (n)
#                       - the height becomes h ≈ log n
#                       - therefore, the time complexity becomed O(h) = O(log n)
#                   - in the case of BSTs being unbalanced
#                       - the height of the tree is approximately the same as the number of nodes
#                           - h ≈ n
#                       - therefore, the time complexity becomes O(h) = O(n)

#                       - the height of the the tree must be minimized
#                           - for that, the tree must become balanced

#           - commonly known as AVL Trees
#               - invented by Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis in 1962
#           - a type of Binary Search Tree, and are self-balancing
#               - meaning, that the tree height is kept to a minimum
#               - so that fast runtime is guaranteed searching, inserting and delete nodes
#                   - with the time complexity of O(log n)
#           - the only difference it and a regular Binary Search Tree
#               - is that an AVL Tree do rotation operations in addition, keeping the tree balanced
#               - in return, AVL trees ensures that it always have a minimum tree hright
#                   - meaning, searching, inserting and deleting operations can be very fast

#           - to restore the balance of an AVL Tree
#               - left or right rotations are done, or a combination of left and right rotations
#           - subtrees change parents during rotation to maintain in-order traversal

#           - The Balance Factor
#               - a node's balance factor is he difference in subtree heights
#               - the subtree heights are stored to each node for all nodes in an AVL tree
#                   - the balance factor is calculated based on its subtree heights
#                       - to check if the tree has become out of balance
#               - the height of a subtree is the number of the edges
#                   - the edges between the root node of the subtree and the leaf nodes farthest down in that subtree
#               - sidenote:
#                   - the balance factor (BF) for a node (X)
#                       - is the difference between its right and left subtrees
#                   - formula
#                       BF(X) = height(right_subtree(X)) - height(left_subtree(X)))
#                   - values
#                       - 0
#                           - the node is in balance
#                       - more than 0
#                           - the node is right-heavy
#                       - less than 0
#                           - the node is left-heavy
#                   - if the balance factor is less than 0, or more than 1
#                       - for one or more node in the tree
#                           - then the tree is not considered balanced
#                       - and a rotation is needed to restore balance
#               - our-of-balance cases
#                   - Left-Left (LL)
#                       - the unbalanced node and its left child node are both left-heavy
#                       - a single right rotation is required to restore balance
#                   - Right-Right (RR)
#                       - the unbalanced node and its right child node are both left-heavy
#                       - a single left rotation is required to restore balance
#                   - Left-Right (LR)
#                       - the unbalanced node is left-heavy
#                           - and its left node is right heavy
#                       - to restore balance, a left rotation on the left child
#                           - then the a right rotation on the unbalanced node
#                   - Right-Left (RL)
#                       - the unbalanced node is right-heavy
#                           - and its left node is left heavy
#                       - to restore balance, a right rotation on the left child
#                           - then the a left rotation on the unbalanced node
#
#               - Left-Left Case
#                   - a node where the unbalance is discovered to be left heavy
#                       - so it the left child node, also being left heavy
#                   - in this case, a single right rotation on the unbalanced node is enough to restore balance

#                   - found through using in-order traversal
#               - this process is similar to deleting a node in a BST
#               - deleting a node in a AVL Tree
#                   - the same code to restore balance is needed
#               - sample code:
#                   def get_lowest_node(node) -> TreeNode:
#                       current = node

#           - Time Complexity in AVL Trees
#               - when looking through an unbalanced BST, the worst case scenario is O(n)
#               - but when searching in an AVL Tree 
#                   - the worst case scenario becomes a constant O(log n)
#               - when deleting, searching or inserting
#                   - the algortihm will only run through the whole height of the tree
#                   - meaning, keeping the height of the tree low
#                       - algorithms will only have a lower runtime
#               - AVL Trees vs BSTs
#                   - a BST is not self-balancing
#                       - it can become very unbalanced
#                           - where the height is nearly the same as the number of nodes
#                       - making operations like inserting, deleting or searching very s;pw
#                           - with a time complexity of O(h) = O(n)
#                   - an AVL Tree however, is self-balancing
#                       - meaning, the height of the tree is kep to a minimum
#                       - such that operations like inserting, deleting or searching
#                           - takes only a time complexity of O(h) = O(log n)
#                   - O(log n)
#                       - in a perfect binary tree
#                           - with a height of 4
#                           - the number of nodes becomes
#                               - 1, 2, 4, 8 or 15
#                           - the same as
#                               - 2^0, 2^1, 2^2. 2^3
#                       - to get the number of nodes n in a perfect binary tree with a height of 5
#                           - it is possible to add the number of nodes together
#                               - 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 = 63
#                           - which is the same as
#                               - 2^6 - 1 = 63
#                       - in general, the formula for the relationship between the height and number of nodes is
#                           - 2^(h + 1) - 1
#                       - relationship between the height of a Tree and the number ot nodes
#                           -            n = 2(h + 1) - 1
#                           -        n + 1 = 2(h + 1)
#                           - log_2(n + 1) = log_2(2^(h + 1))
#                           - log_2(n + 1) = h + 1
#                           -            h = log_2(n + 1) - 1
